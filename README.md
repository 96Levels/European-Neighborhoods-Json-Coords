Neighborhood Geo boundaries: European Cities
===========================================

A collection of jsons with coordinates that define each neighborhood. Thanks to HoodsProject.

As it was imposible to find geo data for neighbours, I drawed directly the polygons using google maps, and some wikipedia pages to get the boundaries of each neigborhood.

Hope it helps.
